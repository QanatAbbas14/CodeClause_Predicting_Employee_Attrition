# Predicting Employee Attrition

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest classifier. Understanding employee attrition is crucial for organizations to retain talent and reduce turnover costs. This project involves data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and building a predictive model to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify whether an employee is likely to leave the organization (attrition). The project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and uncover trends.
- Data Cleaning to ensure data quality.
- Feature Engineering to create informative features.
- Model training using Random Forest to predict employee attrition.

## Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, we explore the data using descriptive statistics, data visualizations, and checking for missing values. Key steps include:

Understanding the distribution of features.
Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
Identifying any anomalies or patterns.
Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering includes:

Dropping irrelevant columns ('Over18', 'EmployeeNumber', 'EmployeeCount', 'StandardHours').
Label encoding categorical variables.
Modifying features, such as creating a new column 'Age_Years'.
Modeling
The Random Forest Classifier is used to build the predictive model. Key steps include:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training the model using the training set.
Evaluating the model on the test set using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.
Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:

Conclusion
The project successfully developed a model to predict employee attrition. The analysis highlighted key factors contributing to attrition, providing valuable insights for HR strategies.

Future Work
Experimenting with other machine learning algorithms.
Fine-tuning the Random Forest model for better accuracy.
Exploring additional features and external data sources to improve predictions.
